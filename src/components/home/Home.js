        Prove you are the best network exec out there by predicting how long
        each new show will last. Compete against friends, family, or even join a
        random group of so called experts by clicking "here".
      </p>
      <p className=''>
        Always try to start your leagues before the premieres of new fall shows
        begin each year, but all predictions for a group only become final at
        the same time. So it's never too late to get a league started, because
        you are just competing in the groups you join. Just know that if a show
        has already started for the year, your friends probably already know it
        has, and will use any advantage they can to prove their dominance. So do
        your research and don't pick multiple seasons for a show that has
        already been cancelled.
